        <p><b>Professional & caring service. We just love our new edition to the family.<br><br>
                We were so impressed with the professionalism of Schultz Liebe Rottweilers. The information book that
                accompanied our puppy was very helpful and thorough.They kept in touch with us and our puppy’s progress.
                Knowing our puppy came from a loving family, of good health and temperament, we would only choose
                Schultz

        <p><b>Highly recommend getting a pup from Schutz Liebe Rottweilers.
                They are very thorough with the instructions they sent home with the new puppy ranging from a full list
                of food that can be eaten along with a blanket which has the smell of mum and dad on it to make it more
                comfortable for the pup to settle in it’s new home.</b></p>

                very loyal friend for us. Thank you, Dee. We are glad to have her as a part of our family member.</b>

        <p><b>Being first dog owners we needed a breeder that was happy to help and wanted our puppy to go to a nice
                home. We were provided with so much information and products that made the transition seamless and
                allowed our little Jarvis to settle in so well. Thank you again for all of your help and attention.</b>
