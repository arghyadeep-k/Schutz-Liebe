					<p>
						We are a small family based kennel, located in South East Queensland. We are high end hobbyist
						breeder, not a commercial breeder. We do not breed for profit, nor to make a living from them.
						First and foremost they are our family and their health and welfare is of our utmost priority.
						<br><br>
						As an ethical breeder we strive to breed the ideal Rottweiler through careful section of our
						breeding dogs.<br>

					<p>
						We ensure that all our breeding dogs go through the following testing:
					<ul style="padding: left 40px;">
						<li>Hips and Elbow</li>
						<li>Eyes and Mouth</li>
						<li>Juvenile Laryngeal Paralysis &amp; Polyneuropathy (JLPP)</li>
						<li>DNA profiling &amp; Parentage</li>
					</ul>
					</p>
					<p>
						We have been involved with the breed since 2003 when we purchased our first rottweiler, since
						then we have own multiple Pedigree Rottweilers and have a deep appreciation for the breed. Some
						years later we decided that we would love to be able to share the joys of this noble breed. We
						endeavoured to secure quality bloodline that would produce true to standard offspring, once we
						obtained the desired bloodlines, we become a registered breeder in 2016 under the prefix of
						SCHUTZLIEBE.
